Developed and implemented a dynamic Student Registration System as a solo project, offering an intuitive and efficient platform for users to easily register their information.

Utilized local storage to ensure data persistence, enabling users to seamlessly access their information across different sessions.

Incorporated a dynamic scrollbar feature to enhance the user experience, allowing for smooth navigation through lengthy task lists.

Integrated strong field validation to prevent empty entries, improving the reliability and integrity of the registration process.

This project highlights my expertise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as my ability to use APIs and DOM manipulation to create a functional and responsive student registration application.
